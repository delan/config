### ~~~ Default rules ~~~ ###

# Never touch loopback interfaces
set skip on lo

# Normalise packets, especially IPv4 DF and Identification
match in all scrub (no-df random-id)

# Block all packets by default, logging them to pflog0
block log

### ~~~ Local configuration traffic ~~~ ###

# RFC 4890, section 4.4
pass quick inet6 proto icmp6 to { (self) ff02::/16 } icmp6-type \
	{ 133 143 135 136 141 142 130 131 132 143 148 149 151 152 153 }

# DHCPv6 client: receive responses to IA_PD requests
pass quick inet6 proto udp to (self) port dhcpv6-client

### ~~~ Bulk pass rules ~~~ ###

# Pass all traffic on internal interfaces
# vether0 is necessary here, but bridge0 is not
pass quick on { vether0 em1 tun0 tun1 }

# Pass all outbound IPv6 traffic
pass out quick inet6 from { (self), (vether0:network) }

# NAT all outbound IPv4 traffic from the rest of our network
pass out quick inet from (vether0:network) nat-to (egress)

# Pass all outbound IPv4 traffic from this host
pass out quick inet from (self)

### ~~~ Block undesirable traffic ~~~ ###

# These rules must not precede the DHCPv6 client or NAT rules above
block log quick from { no-route, urpf-failed, <martians> }
block log quick to { no-route, <martians> }

### ~~~ Pass some ICMP and ICMPv6 traffic ~~~ ####

# Pass all inbound ICMP echo requests
pass in quick inet proto icmp icmp-type { 0 8 }

# RFC 4890, section 4.3
pass quick inet6 proto icmp6 icmp6-type { 1 2 3 4 128 129 144 145 146 147 }

### ~~~ Open services on this router ~~~ ###

# OpenSSH server
pass in proto tcp to (self) port ssh

# mosh server
pass in proto udp to (self) port 60000:61000

# OpenVPN server for venus
pass in proto udp to (self) port 1394

# lookout server
pass in proto tcp to (self) port 9890

# DNS server (nsd)
pass in proto { tcp, udp } to (self) port { 53, 29953 }

### ~~~ Open services on clients ~~~ ###

# Example:

# # host: service
# pass in proto { tcp, udp } to (self) port 41301 rdr-to 172.19.2.13

# uranus: lookout server
pass in proto tcp to 2401:a400:5201:8900:2677:3ff:fe42:3100 port 9890
pass in proto tcp to (self) port 20001 rdr-to 172.19.128.128 port 9890
